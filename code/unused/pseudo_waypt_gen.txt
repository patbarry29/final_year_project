function getWaypoints(σ)
    Clear SafePath, Clear Q
    Add the first point in σ to SafePath 
    for each pair (o,d) in the σ do
        o⋆ ← o
        while there are threats overlapping with a line between o⋆ and d do
            Among all threats overlapping with the line, find threat t with the shortest distance to the line
            Generate waypoint wp on the boundary of threat t, which leads the minimum distance increase in SafePath
            Add wp to SafePath
            o⋆ ← wp 
        end while
        Add d to SafePath
